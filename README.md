# HODL Totals
These Google Apps Scripts will add menu commands to Google Sheets that will help you track cost basis and long-term or short-term treatment for your cryptocurrency trades. It uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method, which is commonly used for tax compliance.

## Usage

- TODO - add details on how to add to new Google Sheets

## Changelog

### PRE-RELEASE STATE
- Ported logic from alanhett's VBScript Macros to Google Apps Script for FIFO cost basis calc.
- Signficant performance issues for > 1000 purchase transactions (long running script may not finish executing before Google times out the job)
