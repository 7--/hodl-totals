## Crypto taxes are a pain.

It is stressful and complicated. It is a barrier to crypto adoption. If you are not a crypto whale, but still racked up a lot of transactions: you cannot afford to spend $2k on crypto tax services.

Introducing HODL Totals, a do-it-yourself, free to use crypto tax solution: an open-source Google Sheets™ add-on that removes the FUD around crypto tracking needed for purposes of US taxation.

Our approach is not to give people another service to hire, but rather teach people to instead count on themselves to come into compliance with tax laws and regulations. We are here to help crypto go mainstream. Anything is possible if you have the right tools and a strong community to help.

"Finished calculating all my crypto taxes with your extension...
      worked like a charm :)
             would have been hell without this!"
                     - cryptoman, 04/06/2021

"Just wanted to say thank you for this tool. It worked well for me!"

"It took a lot of work since this was my first year - but 
I'm going to now do this quarterly and will be much less of a headache for the 
following years. Thanks for putting this together and providing it for free."

"Hey, just found this and its exactly what I was looking for. 
I already had all my transactions in a excel but doing FIFO by hand 
would have taken too long, this saves me hours."

We believe in solutions grounded in the open internet, with code that is open source and available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/dogracer/hodl-totals/blob/main/LICENSE). Unlike the software used by many other crypto service companies, our source code is public so you can download and take a look at the code to see how it works.

Your transaction data is… well yours. You should have a say in what happens to it. Acknowledging that you need to pay taxes should not force you to surrender that data to a crypto tax service. I prefer my crypto data not sitting in a honeypot that could be hacked, like [this service in August 2020](https://www.tokenpost.com/More-than-1000-users-affected-in-a-cryptocurrency-tax-reporting-service-hack-5712). That doesn’t mean you have to live off the grid in a cabin in the woods. With HODL Totals you can choose to put your trust in the Google Drive™ online storage service and in exchange you get a cloud-based user experience that makes crypto tax preparation less painful.

## How HODL Totals helps
It provides a formatted spreadsheet structure you can use to record:
- Transaction Dates
- Transaction IDs
- Coin amount inflows
- Coin amount outflows
- Pricing data
- Wallet information
- Cryptocurrency Addresses

After capturing this data in a HODL Totals sheet, use HODL Total's reconciliation feature to make sure that your data entry was done correctly. You enter in the amount of coins you have in each wallet/account and make sure it all adds up and matches your record of transactions. 

What is taxable vs what is not taxable can be a moving target in the USA as there are plenty of regulatory gray areas to navigate. This is fully under your control by customizing the hidden Categories sheet. Reach out on our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/TWuA9DzZth) and work with the community to learn about aggressive or conservative strategies before deciding for yourself how to report your own transactions.

Once data entry has been confirmed to be correct, you can calculate each transaction's tax status and gain/loss. Our app scripts will add menu commands to Google Sheets™ that will help you track cost basis and long-term or short-term treatment for your cryptocurrency trades. It uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method, which is mostly commonly used for tax compliance, to calculate:

- Profit and loss
- Short-term capital gains
- Long-term capital gains
- Overall coin totals

If you interact with NFTs in addition to crypto coins, you're in luck. There's also an NFT tracker that also will help you determine which NFT transactions need to be reported and which ones do not. The NFT sheets and coin sheets work in tandem to enable you to accurately report all of it.

Big into De-FI? That's also covered. If it can be done on chain, it can be tracked in these sheets!
