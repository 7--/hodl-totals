## Crypto taxes are a pain.

It is stressful and complicated. It is a barrier to crypto adoption.

We are here to help crypto go mainstream, by providing HODL Totals: free and open-source Google Sheet tools that aim remove the FUD around crypto taxation.

Our approach is not to give people another service to hire, bur rather to teach people to instead to count on themselves to come into compliance with tax laws and regulations. Anything is possible if you have the right tools and a strong community to help.

   "Just finished calculating all my crypto taxes with your extension...
          worked like a charm :)
                   And thanks again, would have been hell without this!"
                                          - cryptoman, 04/06/2021

We believe in solutions grounded in the open internet, with code that is open source and available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/dogracer/hodl-totals/blob/main/LICENSE). Unlike the software used by many other crypto service companies, our source code is public so you can actually download and take a look at the code to see how it works.

Your transaction data is… well yours. You should have a say in what happens to it. Acknowledging that you need to pay taxes should not force you to surrender that data to a crypto tax service. I prefer my crypto data not sitting in a honeypot that could be hacked, like [this service in August 2020](https://www.tokenpost.com/More-than-1000-users-affected-in-a-cryptocurrency-tax-reporting-service-hack-5712). That doesn’t mean you have to live off the grid in a cabin in the woods. With HODL Totals you can choose to put your trust in Google Drive’s secure data centers with encrypted storage and in exchange you get a cloud-based user experience that makes crypto tax preparation less painful.

## How HODL Totals helps
It provides a formatted spreadsheet structure you can use to record:
- Transaction Dates
- Transaction IDs
- Coin amount inflows
- Coin amount outflows
- Pricing data
- Wallet information
- Cryptocurrency Addresses

After capturing this data in a HODL Totals sheet, our JavaScript scripts execute upon your data in order to provide you with useful computations. Our Google Apps Scripts will add menu commands to the Google Sheet that will help you track cost basis and long-term or short-term treatment for your cryptocurrency trades. It uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method, which is commonly used for tax compliance, to calculate:

- Profit and loss
- Short-term capital gains
- Long-term capital gains
- Overall coin totals

The initial prerelease version of our tool is working and has assisted people with their 2020 US income taxes.
