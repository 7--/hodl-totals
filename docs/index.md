## HODL Totals

Crypto taxes are a pain. It is stressful and complicated. It is a barrier to crypto adoption.

We are here to help crypto go mainstream, by providing HODL Totals: free and open-source Google Sheet tools that aim remove the FUD around crypto taxation.

Our approach is not to give people another service to hire, bur rather to teach people to instead to count on themselves to come into compliance with tax laws and regulations. Anything is possible if you have the right tools and a strong community to help.

We believe in solutions grounded in the open internet, with code that is open source and available under the General Public License (“GPL”). Unlike the software used by many other crypto service companies, our source code is public so you can actually download and take a look at the code to see how it works.

The HODL Totals Google Sheet Add-On helps the user capture:
- Transaction Dates
- Transaction IDs
- Coin amount inflows
- Coin amount outflows
- Pricing data
- Wallet information
- Cryptocurrency Addresses

After capturing this data in a HODL Totals sheet, our JavaScript scripts execute upon your data in order to provide you with useful computations. Our Google Apps Scripts will add menu commands to the Google Sheet that will help you track cost basis and long-term or short-term treatment for your cryptocurrency trades. It uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method, which is commonly used for tax compliance. 

We calculate:
- Profit and loss
- Short-term capital gains
- Long-term capital gains
- Overall coin totals

The initial prerelease version of our tool is working and has assisted people with their 2020 US income taxes.
